# Loan-Prediction

The Loan Prediction project aims to predict if a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan or not based on various factors such as credit score, income, loan amount, etc. The data for this project could include the following attributes:

* Loan ID: A unique identifier for each loan.
* Gender: Gender of the loan applicant.
* Married: Marital status of the loan applicant.
* Dependents: Number of dependents of the loan applicant.
* Education: Education level of the loan applicant.
* Self-Employed: Whether the loan applicant is self-employed or not.
* Applicant Income: Income of the loan applicant.
* Coapplicant Income: Income of the co-applicant, if any.
* Loan Amount: The amount of loan applied for.
* Loan Amount Term: The term of the loan in months.
* Credit History: The credit history of the loan applicant.
* Property Area: The area of the property, if any, for which the loan has been applied for.
* Loan Status: The target variable, whether the loan was approved or not.
This data can be used to build a machine learning model that can predict the loan status based on the other attributes. This can be useful for financial institutions to make informed decisions about loan approvals, saving time and resources in manual loan processing



we are going to work on binary classification problem
we are going to work on binary classification problem, where we got some information about sample of peoples , and we need to predict whether we should give some one a loan or not depending on his information . we actually have a few sample size (614 rows), so we will go with machine learning techniques to solve our problem .

what you will learn in this kernel ?

- basics of visualizing the data .
- how to compare between feature importance (at less in this data) .
 - feature selection
 - feature engineer
- some simple techniques to process the data .
- handling missing data .
- how to deal with categorical and numerical data .
- outliers data detection
- but the most important thing that you will learn , is how to evaluate your model at every step you take .
